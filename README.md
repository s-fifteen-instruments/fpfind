# fpfind

An add-on implementation of frequency compensation for [qcrypto](https://github.com/s-fifteen-instruments/qcrypto).

## Usage

Requirements:

* Python 3.8 and above, running in Linux
* `gcc` (if running `freqcd`, preferably in PATH for auto-compilation)

The stable releases are tagged and listed [here](https://github.com/s-fifteen-instruments/fpfind/tags). For example, to install the `v2.2.x` version:

```bash
# Remote installation
pip3 install git+https://github.com/s-fifteen-instruments/fpfind.git@v2.2.x

# Local installation
git clone -b "v2.2.x" https://github.com/s-fifteen-instruments/fpfind.git
cd fpfind && pip3 install .
```

Binaries and scripts will be exposed to the path; commonly used scripts are listed below.

```bash
fpfind -t {TIMESTAMPS1} -T {TIMESTAMPS2}
freqcd -X -udF fpipe -f 568 < {TIMESTAMPS}
[costream -V5 ... |] freqservo -V5 -udF fpipe -f 568
parse-timestamps -A1 -X -p {TIMESTAMPS}
show-timestamps {TIMESTAMPS}
```

## Motivation

Quantum key distribution requires some form of clock synchronization to retain high signal-noise ratio when pairing photon detection/generation events. This is usually achieved by having a stable clock (e.g. Rb clock, GPS receiver) or a separate clock transfer channel.

Timing correlated photons used in the QKD itself can also be used as a resource for clock synchronization, by identifying and tracking the timing delay $\tau$ using the second-order coherence $g^{(2)}(\tau)$. The timing drift in the signal indicates a frequency offset/drift between the two parties, which can be corrected with a feedback loop. This opens up the use of clock references with weaker frequency stability like quartz clocks.

This library implements the frequency compensation modules supplementing the core [qcrypto](https://github.com/s-fifteen-instruments/qcrypto) QKD software stack, and a reference usage can be found in [QKDServer](https://github.com/s-fifteen-instruments/QKDServer).

## Schematic

Components for frequency compensation (implemented in this library) are highlighted in yellow below.

![](docs/qcrypto_fpfind.png)

In particular:

* `freqcd.c` performs frequency correction
* `fpfind.py` replaces `pfind.c` for initial frequency estimation
* `freqservo.py` performs frequency drift estimation

## Limitations

* The FFT buffer size is limited to 2**31 bins due to the implicit casting to `int32` performed internally by `np.bincount` on older versions of `numpy`. This corresponds to a buffer order value upper bounded to `q = 31` for `fpfind`. To bypass this limitation, supply an alternative implementation for `np.bincount`.

## Troubleshooting

Certain issues may appear when attempting an install on RaspbianOS:

* Importing `numpy` yields the error message stating `libopenblas.so` could not be found (this is the underlying linear algebra library for Numpy); installing the `libopenblas-dev` library fixes this, e.g. `apt install libopenblas-dev`

## Contributing

Version tags (as of **v2**) follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), with a build string indicating the date of release in "YYYYMMDD" format, e.g. **v2.0.0+20241024**.
This allows clear indication to the user whether the local version is severely outdated, while maintaining the clarity of semantic versioning.
Dynamic versioning is handled by poetry, so bumping the version simply involves adding a lightweight git tag (with "v" prepended, e.g. `git tag {VERSION} [COMMIT]`).

Commit messages to roughly follow [Angular commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) (which aligns with the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)). The type should be one of the following: **feat**, **fix**, **perf**, **refactor**, **style**, **test**, **docs**, **build**.
If a scope is provided, it should be one of:

* **fpfind**
* **fpplot**
* **freqcd**
* **freqservo**
* **parser** (for both timestamp and epoch)

Commit messages can be automatically checked using `pre-commit`, after installing:

```bash
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```
